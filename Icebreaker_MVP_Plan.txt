# MVP Plan: Icebreaker ‚Äì Proximity-Based Social Connection App

## üéØ Objective
Build a privacy-first mobile app that helps users connect with people physically nearby by breaking the first-contact barrier. Users must explicitly opt in to be discoverable. Profiles can be matched and recommended based on proximity and mutual interests.

---

## üöÄ Core Features (MVP)

### 1. User Onboarding
- Sign up / Log in (email, phone number, or OAuth)
- Profile creation:
  - Name (first name only shown publicly)
  - Optional profile photo (with toggle for visibility)
  - Age (or age range)
  - Interests/tags
  - Bio (optional)
  - Visibility preferences (visible to others nearby or not)

### 2. Discovery & Proximity Engine
- Toggle: "Visible to nearby users"
- Detect nearby users using:
  - GPS for rough proximity (city, venue)
  - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi for fine-grain detection
- Range control: Choose visibility range (5m, 10m, 20m)
- Only show users who are also opted in
- Users shown as avatars or anonymized until they accept a request

### 3. Profile Interaction
- View nearby users' basic profiles (based on preferences)
- Mutual interest indicator (e.g., shared tags)
- Optional: Profile picture visible if user allows
- Send a ‚Äúwave‚Äù or ‚Äúicebreaker‚Äù
- Conversation starter suggestions based on shared interests

### 4. Friend Request System
- Send friend request
- User receives anonymous alert: ‚ÄúSomeone nearby is interested in connecting‚Äù
- Accepting request reveals full profile and enables chat
- One-to-one chat (text only, no media in MVP)

### 5. Privacy & Safety
- Full opt-in visibility
- Photo visibility toggle (public/private/per session)
- Block & report system
- Limit contact attempts per user per day
- Expire visibility after 30 mins or upon leaving zone
- Profile activity status (online/offline)

### 6. Settings & Preferences
- Visibility controls (radius, duration, picture visibility)
- Interests management
- Profile edit
- Opt-in/opt-out of discovery mode
- Notification settings

- AI-generated conversation starters
- Event-based discovery (e.g., at concerts, conferences)
- Verified profiles
- Mood or vibe-based matching
- Group discovery mode
- Local language/translation options
- Lightweight games for breaking the ice

## üì¶ Deliverables
- React Native mobile app (iOS + Android)
- Functional backend with REST API
- Location + BLE-based discovery engine
- Chat and friend request system
- Safety and moderation features
- MVP-level UI/UX

---

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics
- % of users who opt-in to visibility
- Number of waves/friend requests per session
- Average session length
- Retention after first interaction (Day 1/Day 7)
- Reported safety incidents (should be 0)
